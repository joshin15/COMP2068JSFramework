       <p>
           German Shepherds are highly intelligent and versatile working dogs. They are known for their loyalty, courage, and protective instincts,
           making them popular choices for police, military, and search-and-rescue work. German Shepherds require regular exercise, training,
           and socialization to fulfill their potential as well-rounded companions.
