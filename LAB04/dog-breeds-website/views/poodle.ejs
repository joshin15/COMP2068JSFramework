       <h1>Poodle Information</h1>
       <p>
           Poodles are known for their intelligence, elegance, and hypoallergenic coats. They come in three size varieties: standard, miniature, and toy.
           Poodles are highly trainable and excel in various canine sports and activities, including obedience, agility, and retrieving. Regular grooming
           is essential to maintain the poodle's distinctive curly coat.
