       <h1>Bulldog Information</h1>
       <p>
           Bulldogs are known for their distinctive wrinkled face and pushed-in nose. They are a medium-sized breed with a gentle and affectionate temperament.
           Despite their intimidating appearance, bulldogs are typically friendly and excellent companions, especially for families.
           Bulldogs may require special care due to their brachycephalic nature, including monitoring for respiratory issues and providing regular exercise.
